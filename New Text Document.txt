The subclass of SQLException thrown when the SQLState class value is '0A' ( the value is 'zero' A). This indicates that the JDBC driver does not support an optional JDBC feature. Optional JDBC features can fall into the following categories:
no support for an optional feature
no support for an optional overloaded method
no support for an optional mode for a method. The mode for a method is determined based on constants passed as parameter values to a method
